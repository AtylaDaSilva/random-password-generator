# Random Password Generator

### Overview

Generate pseudo-random passwords with numbers, symbols, lower and upper case letters up to 100 characters.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and created with React 18.2.0, Bootstrap 5.3.2 and Bootstrap Icons 1.11.2.

### Security

The passwords generated by this app or any data related to the passwords are ***not*** stored in any shape or form, be it locally (through the browser's local and/or session storage) or sent to a database. The Random Password Generator is completely safe to use, pinky promise.

If you spot anything that could be considered a threat to security, be it in the code or in the app itself, please report it through the Git Hub Issues tab and I'll get to it as soon as possible.

### Running a development environment

To get this app running in a development environment:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js and NPM. They can be downloaded for free [here](https://nodejs.org/en);
2. Clone the repository to wherever you'd like;
3. Open your CLI of choice (Windows Command Prompt, Powershell, VSCode Terminal, etc..) and `cd` to the directory of the repository you just cloned;
4. In the terminal, run `npm install` and wait until the process finishes. This will install all the necessary dependencies;
5. Still in the terminal, run `npm start` to start a local development environment. Your web browser should pop up automatically in the environment, but if it does not, the url should be `http://localhost:3000/`
