# Random Password Generator

### Overview

Generate pseudo-random passwords with numbers, symbols, lower and upper case letters up to 100 characters.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and created with React 18.2.0, Bootstrap 5.3.2 and Bootstrap Icons 1.11.2.

### Security

The passwords generated by this app or any data related to the passwords are ***not*** stored in any shape or form, be it locally (through the browser's local and/or session storage) or sent to a database. The Random Password Generator is completely safe to use, pinky promise.

If you spot anything that could be considered a threat to security, be it in the code or in the app itself, please report it through the Git Hub Issues tab and I'll get to it as soon as possible.
